/**
 The windows per pane of a paned layout, in window-list order: main first, then the side panes.

 The window list stays pane-contiguous: the first `counts[0]` windows are main, the next `counts[1]` the first side pane,
 and so on. Swap, swap-main and drag-swap work on list order and keep these sizes; warp and arriving or departing windows
 change them.

 The layout's main pane count is a maximum: main holds at most that many windows. It fills by warp, by a window arriving
 at the front of the list (`main-arrival-position: first`), or by new windows while the side panes are empty.
