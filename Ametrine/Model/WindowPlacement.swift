 Why a tracked window tiles or floats, recorded when the decision is made so that `explain-window` reports what actually happened rather than what the rules would say now.

 The `floating` cases describe which part of the `floating` list matched; whether that means floating or tiling depends on `floating-is-blacklist`.
