# Configuration file

Ametrine is configured only through its config file. There is no preferences window.

## Where it lives

The first file that exists is used:

1. `~/.ametrine.yml`
2. `~/.config/ametrine/ametrine.yml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ametrine/ametrine.yml`)
3. `~/.ametrine` (JSON)

- **Missing or broken file:** if there's no file, or it can't be read, Ametrine shows an alert with the path and quits.
- **Menu:** **Edit Config…** opens the file in its default editor. **Reload Config** relaunches the app so changes apply.
- **Defaults:** settings the file leaves out get the built-in defaults below, on every load.
- **Examples:** the [README](../README.md#configuration) has a short one; [ametrine.sample.yml](../ametrine.sample.yml) is a complete, real config.

## Settings

| Key | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `layouts` | Ordered list of layouts to use, by layout key (default `tall-left`, `wide-top`, `fullscreen`, `column-left`). See [layouts](layouts.md) for the keys and how each layout works. |
| `layout-names` | The name shown for a layout in the menu bar, the HUD, the Layouts menu and the palette, by layout key, e.g. `tall-left: "Coding"`. A layout left out, or with an empty or non-text name, shows its key (default none, so every layout shows its key). |
| `mod1` | First modifier combination, a list of `option`, `control`, `shift`, `command` (default `option` + `shift`). Required. |
| `mod2` | Second modifier combination (default `option` + `shift` + `control`). Required. |
| `mod3` | Third modifier combination (optional, none by default). |
| `mod4` | Fourth modifier combination (optional, none by default). |
| `window-max-count` | The max number of windows visible on a screen at once; more are minimised or float (`window-overflow`). `0` turns the limit off (default `0`). |
| `window-overflow` | What happens to windows over `window-max-count`: `minimize` (the oldest window outside the main pane) or `float` (the newest windows float, centred, and the tiles stay as they are). Default `minimize`. See [window limit](window-limit.md). |
| `window-overflow-size` | The size of a window floated over the limit: `reasonable` (60% × 70% of the screen's usable area) or `fixed` (`window-overflow-width` × `window-overflow-height`). Default `reasonable`. |
| `window-overflow-reasonable-width` / `window-overflow-reasonable-height` | The `reasonable` overflow window size, in percent of the screen's usable width and height (1–100; defaults `60` and `70`). |
| `window-overflow-width` / `window-overflow-height` | The `fixed` overflow window size in points; never bigger than the screen. `0` = not set, and `fixed` then falls back to `reasonable` (default `0`). |
| `window-margins` | `true` to add margins between and around windows (default `false`). |
| `smart-window-margins` | `true` to drop the margins when there is only one window on the screen, if margins are on (default `false`). |
| `window-margin-size` | Size of the margins between and around windows (in px, default `0`). |
| `window-minimum-height` | Smallest height a window can be sized to, regardless of its layout frame (in px, default `0`). |
| `window-minimum-width` | Smallest width a window can be sized to, regardless of its layout frame (in px, default `0`). |
| `floating` | Applications that float (or tile, see `floating-is-blacklist`), by bundle identifier (default `[]`). An entry is an id (exact, or a `*` glob) or `{id: ..., window-titles: [...]}` to match only some windows. Titles are unanchored, case-sensitive regexes: use `^…$` and `(?i)`. The first matching entry wins. |
| `floating-is-blacklist` | `true` if the apps in `floating` float and all others tile; `false` for the opposite (default `true`). |
| `floating-secondary-windows` | Applications whose first window on a Space tiles while their other windows (Settings, dialogs, Open panels) float. Ids match like `floating`. It's a separate list, so `floating`'s "first match wins" rule doesn't apply (default `[]`). |
| `ignore-menu-bar` | `true` to lay windows out over the whole screen, menu bar and Dock area included (default `false`). |
| `float-small-windows` | `true` if windows smaller than `small-window-size` should float (default `true`). A valid option on its own; it also used to serve as a workaround for secondary windows that Electron and similar apps draw as normal windows, which `floating-secondary-windows` now handles. The size is checked when a window opens, and macOS reopens windows at their last size, so a window from a small tile can come back floating; see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#a-reopened-window-floats-where-it-used-to-be). |
| `small-window-size` | Threshold for `float-small-windows`: windows below this width and height are small (in px, default `500`). |
| `mouse-follows-focus` | `true` to move the mouse to the centre of a window when it gets focus (default `false`). Largely incompatible with `focus-follows-mouse`. |
| `focus-follows-mouse` | `true` to focus the window under the mouse as it moves (default `false`). Largely incompatible with `mouse-follows-focus`. |
| `mouse-swaps-windows` | `true` to swap windows by dragging one onto another (default `false`). |
| `mouse-resizes-windows` | `true` to update the layout when a window is resized with the mouse (default `false`). Not every layout can follow. |
| `mouse-warps-windows` | `true` to warp a dragged tiled window instead of swapping it when Shift (alone) is held as you drop it (default `false`). It lands by the rules of `warp-<direction>`: dropped on a window in another pane, it joins that pane right after it (into main, at `main-arrival-position`); on a window in its own pane, or when it's the last window of its pane, it swaps; dropped on an empty column, it becomes that column's window. In BSP it splits the tile it's dropped on and takes the half under the cursor. Two Pane, Column and Row swap; Fullscreen and Floating do nothing. The cursor stays where you dropped. Works without `mouse-swaps-windows`. |
| `snap-back-windows` | `true` to keep tiled windows on their tiles (default `true`). **With the mouse:** a window you drag or resize goes back on release when the layout doesn't take the change: dropped on its own tile (in Fullscreen, anywhere), a gap, the padding or anywhere without a tile, a Shift-drop that can't warp, or a resize the layout can't follow (`mouse-resizes-windows` off, or a layout without a main pane ratio such as BSP or Fullscreen). **By other apps:** a window that Raycast, a script or another app moves or resizes goes back a quarter second after the last change. An app adjusting its own size in place (a minimum size, a terminal's character grid), windows pushed aside by show desktop and native full screen are left alone, and a window goes back this way at most once a second. With `false`, windows stay where they were put until the next layout pass. Floating windows and the Floating layout are never moved. |
| `enables-layout-hud` | `true` to show a short on-screen message when the layout, padding mode or main pane count changes (default `true`). |
| `enables-layout-hud-on-space-change` | `true` to show the layout name when moving to another Space (default `true`). |
| `enables-window-count-hud` | `true` to show the new window max count on screen after increasing or decreasing it (default `false`). |
| `enables-refused-tile-hud` | `true` to show a short message when a tiled window stays bigger than its tile (an app's minimum size), once per window and tile size (default `true`). |
| `focus-border` | `true` to draw a border around the focused window (default `false`). Only windows Ametrine manages, tiled or floating; none for tiled windows in the Fullscreen layout or in native full screen. It sits just outside the window, in the margin, and never covers the window itself. |
| `focus-border-style` | `glow` (a thin ring with a soft glow, like the macOS focus ring), `solid` or `gradient` (default `glow`). |
| `focus-border-width` | Points: the ring width for `solid` and `gradient`, and how far the glow reaches (default `5`). |
| `focus-border-color` | `accent` (the system accent colour, following System Settings), `"#RRGGBB"` or `"#AARRGGBB"` (default `accent`). Quote hex colours in YAML. |
| `focus-border-gradient` | The two colours of the `gradient` style, top left to bottom right (default `["#9B5DE5", "#F4B942"]`, purple to gold). |
| `focus-border-radius` | Corner radius in points (default `12`), used when the window server doesn't report the window's own radius; normally the border follows each window's own corners. |
| `main-arrival-position` | Where a window arriving in the main pane goes: `first` or `last` (default `last`). `first`: on top of main (left when main's windows are side by side); with main full, its last window moves out. `last`: at the end; it joins main only while main has room, so main stays as it is. A window coming back into view (unhidden, unminimised, back from another Space, tiled again) arrives the same way, and so does a window warped into main (`warp-<direction>`): on top with `first`, at the bottom with `last`, wherever its neighbour is. Swaps (`swap-main`, `swap-<direction>`) don't use it: they exchange two windows' places. Replaces `new-windows-to-main` (`true` = `first`, `false` = `last`). See [arriving and leaving](layouts.md#windows-arriving-and-leaving). |
| `window-resize-step` | Percentage of the screen size by which `shrink-main` and `expand-main` change the main pane (default `5`). |
| `padding-modes` | Named sets of screen paddings, e.g. `- {name: wide, top: 540}`. Sides left out are `0`. Switch with the padding commands or the Padding menu; each Space has its own (default none). |
| `padding-mode` | The mode a Space uses until you pick one on it. Each Space keeps the mode picked there, also across restarts (default none). |
| `screen-padding-left` | Space between windows and the left screen edge, used when no padding mode is active (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-right` | Same for the right edge (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-top` | Same for the top edge (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-bottom` | Same for the bottom edge (in px, default `0`). |
| `disable-padding-on-builtin-display` | `true` to apply no screen padding on a built-in display (default `false`). |
| `restore-layouts-on-launch` | `true` to keep layouts across restarts and Reload Config (default `true`): each Space comes back on the layout it was on, with its main pane size, main pane count and column sizes, and the windows keep their places (main pane included); `swap-main` from the main window still swaps back with the window that was there before. Windows opened while Ametrine wasn't running go after them. A layout no longer in `layouts` falls back to the first one. |
| `debug-layout-info` | `true` to add debug information to the layout HUD (default `false`). |
| `hide-menu-bar-icon` | `true` to hide the menu bar icon, and with it the current layout's name shown next to it (default `false`). |
| `menu-bar-counts` | Start the menu bar title with counts the layout doesn't show. Main: a filled dot per window in main, an open one per free place (`M:●○` = room for the next window), digits above three places (`M:5/7`), `M:–` without a main pane. Stack, in Fullscreen and Two Pane: every window in the stack, the front one included (`S:4`) (default `true`). |

## Commands

A command is bound to a key only if the file binds it, with an object holding `mod` and `key`:

```yaml
cycle-layout:
  mod: mod1
  key: "."
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `mod` | `mod1`, `mod2`, `mod3` or `mod4`. |
| `key` | The key: a character (quote digits and symbols, e.g. `"0"`), or `space`, `enter`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `delete`. |

- **No built-in keys.** Leaving a command out, setting it to `false`, or binding it to `<NONE>` leaves it unbound.
- **Unbound still runs.** Every command, bound or not, can be run from the command palette or with `open -g "ametrine://command/<command-key>"`.
- **Commands that take a number** (`set-window-max-count`, `set-main-pane-count`) have no key. In the palette, picking one turns the search field into a number field: type the number and press Enter (Esc goes back to the list). By URL, pass the number as `value`, e.g. `open -g "ametrine://command/set-window-max-count?value=8"`; a missing or invalid value is logged and ignored.

### Command keys

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ------------|
| `cycle-layout` | Move to the next layout in the list. |
| `cycle-layout-backward` | Move to the previous layout in the list. |
| `select-<layout-key>-layout` | Switch to that layout, e.g. `select-tall-left-layout`; selecting the current layout again goes back to the one used before it on this Space. Only works for layouts listed in `layouts`. |
| `toggle-fullscreen` | Switch this Space between its layout and Fullscreen. The focused window comes to the front without becoming main, and going back puts every window in the tile it had, with the layout's main count and pane sizes. Works whether or not `fullscreen` is in `layouts`. |
| `flip-twin` | Show the layout's mirror image: switch to its twin (Tall Left ↔ Tall Right, …) with main count, ratio and pane sizes handed over. A twin in `layouts` is selected; otherwise the current entry becomes the twin in place, and flipping again or selecting the listed layout brings it back. In 3Column Middle the left and right columns swap windows and sizes (both need a window). Nothing in BSP, Fullscreen, Floating. See [flip](layouts.md#flip). |
| `flip-rows` | Reverse the order inside every pane whose windows stack as rows (Tall's main and stack, every 3Column and 4Column column, Widescreen Tall's stack, Row). Panes don't move; flipping again restores the order. In BSP, swap the halves of every split with one half above the other. |
| `flip-columns` | Reverse the order inside every pane whose windows sit side by side (Wide's rows, Widescreen Tall's main, Column). Panes don't move; flipping again restores the order. In BSP, swap the halves of every side-by-side split. |
| `shrink-main` | Shrink the main pane by `window-resize-step`, down to 5% of the screen (so neither pane disappears). Not every layout responds. |
| `expand-main` | Expand the main pane by `window-resize-step`, up to 95% of the screen. Not every layout responds. |
| `increase-main` | Raise the most windows the main pane may hold, and show "x of y" (the windows in main, of the maximum). Nothing moves: main fills by `warp-<direction>`, by a window arriving with `main-arrival-position: first`, or by new windows while the side panes are still empty. When a main window leaves view (closed, quit, hidden, minimised, moved to another Space, floated), main holds one fewer and the maximum stays; main never empties while there are windows. Warping a window out of main lowers the maximum by one; warping into a full main raises it by one. This is how Tall, Wide, Widescreen Tall, 3Column and 4Column work; in Column and Row the count is the number of main windows, lowered when one leaves view. See [main count](layouts.md#main-count-is-a-maximum). |
| `decrease-main` | Lower the maximum, and show "x of y". Main's windows beyond it move to the first side pane. |
| `set-main-pane-count` | Set the maximum (1–99), as `increase-main` and `decrease-main` do, and show it. Palette and URL only. Only layouts with an adjustable main pane respond. |
| `increase-window-max-count` | Raise `window-max-count` by one until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-window-count-hud` is on. |
| `decrease-window-max-count` | Lower `window-max-count` by one until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-window-count-hud` is on. |
| `toggle-window-overflow` | Switch `window-overflow` between `minimize` and `float` until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-window-count-hud` is on. Windows already minimised or floated stay so. |
| `toggle-window-overflow-size` | Switch `window-overflow-size` between `reasonable` and `fixed` until Reload Config (stays `reasonable` without a configured size), and show it if `enables-window-count-hud` is on. |
| `toggle-focus-border` | Turn `focus-border` on or off until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-layout-hud` is on. |
| `cycle-focus-border-style` | Switch `focus-border-style` to the next style (glow, solid, gradient) until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-layout-hud` is on. |
| `toggle-main-arrival-position` | Switch `main-arrival-position` between `first` and `last` until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-layout-hud` is on. |
| `toggle-snap-back-windows` | Turn `snap-back-windows` on or off until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-layout-hud` is on; off, another app's move or resize stays. |
| `set-window-max-count` | Set `window-max-count` (0–99, `0` = unlimited) until Reload Config, and show it if `enables-window-count-hud` is on. Palette and URL only. |
| `focus-ccw` | Focus the next window counter-clockwise. |
| `focus-cw` | Focus the next window clockwise. |
| `focus-main` | Focus the main window. |
| `swap-ccw` | Swap the focused window with the next one counter-clockwise. |
| `swap-cw` | Swap the focused window with the next one clockwise. |
| `swap-main` | Swap the focused window with the main window. |
| `focus-west` … `focus-south` | Focus the tiled window in that direction (`west`, `east`, `north`, `south`). Only visible windows count: of windows stacked in one tile (Two Pane's secondary) only the front one is reached. Ties go to the window used most recently. From a floating window it reaches the nearest tile in that direction; floating windows are never a target. At the screen edge nothing happens (no wrap-around, no other display). In Fullscreen, west/east cycle through the windows and north/south do nothing. In Two Pane, north/south browse the windows waiting behind the secondary pane, from main too (west/east on a portrait screen). See [directional focus and swap](directional-navigation.md). |
| `swap-west` … `swap-south` | Swap the focused window with the tiled window in that direction (found as for `focus-<direction>`). Focus and, with `mouse-follows-focus`, the cursor go with the window. Nothing happens from a floating window or in Fullscreen. |
| `warp-west` … `warp-south` | Move the focused window into the pane in that direction, so that pane grows by one and its own shrinks: it lands right after the neighbour (found as for `focus-<direction>`), or in main by `main-arrival-position`. A neighbour in the same pane, or the last window of a pane (a warp never empties one), swaps instead; so does every warp in Two Pane, Column and Row. A side column left without windows can be warped into. In BSP the window leaves its tile and splits the neighbour's. Focus and, with `mouse-follows-focus`, the cursor go with the window. Nothing happens from a floating window or in Fullscreen and Floating. See [warp](directional-navigation.md#warp). |
| `warp-main` | Move the focused window into main from wherever it is: on top of main or at the bottom by `main-arrival-position`, and its own pane shrinks. The last window of a pane swaps with main's top window instead; in Two Pane, Column and Row it swaps with main, like `swap-main`. Nothing happens from main, from a floating window, or in BSP, Fullscreen, Floating. |
| `toggle-float` | Toggle floating for the focused window. |
| `explain-window` | Show in a HUD whether the focused window is tiled, floating or not managed, and why. |
| `display-current-layout` | Show the layout HUD with the current layout. |
| `toggle-tiling` | Turn tiling on or off. |
| `enable-tiling` | Turn tiling on. |
| `disable-tiling` | Turn tiling off. |
| `reevaluate-windows` | Re-check which windows are managed and lay them out again. |
| `toggle-focus-follows-mouse` | Turn `focus-follows-mouse` on or off. |
| `cycle-padding-mode` | Switch the current Space to the next padding mode (wraps around). |
| `cycle-padding-mode-backward` | Switch the current Space to the previous padding mode (wraps around). |
| `select-<name>-padding-mode` | Switch the current Space to that padding mode, e.g. `select-wide-padding-mode`. |
| `show-command-palette` | Open (or close) the command palette. |
| `show-shortcuts` | Open (or close) the shortcut sheet: your bound keys at a glance, the focus/warp/swap grid on top and the rest grouped like the config. Also **Shortcuts…** in the menu bar. |
| `relaunch-ametrine` | Quit and reopen Ametrine (also what Reload Config does). |
