# Manual tests

The unit tests cover the layouts' arithmetic. They can't reach what happens between Ametrine and macOS: which events arrive, in which order, and which apps don't send them. Run these by hand after any change to window tracking, focus or floating, before it's merged.

Use three or four everyday apps from different vendors (a terminal, a browser, an editor, an Electron app). The bugs found so far depended on the app.

## Window tracking

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Hide one of three tiled apps with ⌘H | No empty tile; the others fill the screen. |
| Unhide it | It tiles again. |
| Quit an app that has a window you opened after Ametrine started | Its tile closes up. |
| Close a window while another Space is showing, then come back | No empty tile. |
| Minimise a tiled window, then restore it | It leaves and rejoins the layout. |

## Focus

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Click a window of another app, then open a new window in a third app | Layouts that place new windows by focus (BSP) put it next to the window you clicked. |
| With a terminal in front, use focus and swap shortcuts | They act on the terminal's window. |
| 3Column 1/3/1: focus a lower middle window, focus west, then east | Back on the same middle window. |
| Two Pane with three windows: from main, focus east, then west and east again | Only the visible secondary is reached. |
| Two Pane A and B with four windows: from main, focus south three times, then north | The waiting windows come forward one by one in window order and wrap around; north goes back; main is never focused. |
| From a floating Settings window, focus west | The nearest tile to the west gets focus. |
| Fullscreen: focus west/east, then north/south | West/east cycle through all windows with wrap-around; north/south do nothing. |
| Swap east from main | Main and its neighbour trade places; focus and the cursor stay on the moved window. |
| With `focus-border: true`, move focus by key, then by clicking | The border follows; Ametrine never takes focus. |
| Drag and resize the focused window | The border follows it. |
| Click inside the focused window (Safari: the address bar, then the page) | The border stays on top, with no window shadow over it. |
| In CotEditor, select text with the mouse and with Shift+arrows; focus another app and move back (`focus-<direction>`, Alt-Tab) | The border stays on top of CotEditor throughout. |
| Drag a floating window (System Settings) around quickly, then resize it by an edge | The border stays visible and moves with the window, without trailing or flicker. |
| 3Column, main count 3: close the focused main window | The border goes to the newly focused window; no border is left behind at a window's old place. |
| Open a floating Settings window | It gets the border; the tile behind loses it. |
| Switch to the Fullscreen layout, then open a native full-screen app | No border in either. |
| ⌘H the focused app; switch Space | The border moves to the newly focused window (or disappears). |

## Mouse and snap-back

With `mouse-swaps-windows`, `mouse-warps-windows`, `mouse-resizes-windows` and `snap-back-windows` all `true`.

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Drag a tiled window onto another and drop | They swap. |
| Same, holding Shift as you drop, onto a window in another pane (3Column 1/2/2) | It joins that pane right after the window it was dropped on; its old pane shrinks by one (1/1/3). |
| Shift-drop onto main | It joins main at `main-arrival-position`; main grows by one. |
| Shift-drop onto an empty column (3Column after main took the column's only window) | It becomes that column's window. |
| Shift-drop the only window of a pane onto another pane | They swap; no pane is emptied. |
| BSP: Shift-drop onto the left, then the right half of a wide tile | It splits that tile and takes the half it was dropped on. |
| Shift+⌘ while dropping | A plain swap. |
| Drop a window on its own tile, on the padding, or in a gap | It goes back to its tile. |
| Fullscreen: drag the front window and drop it anywhere | It goes back; the stack order is unchanged. |
| Raycast "reasonable size" in Fullscreen, then "left half" in Tall | Each goes back to its tile about a quarter second later. |
| Click the wallpaper twice (show desktop and back) | Windows slide aside and come back untouched. |
| Native full screen (green button) and back | It enters and leaves full screen normally. |
| A terminal in a tile (character grid) | No repeated layout passes in the `--log` ("Snap back" lines). |
| Resize a window in BSP or Fullscreen with the mouse | It goes back to its tile on release. |
| Run `toggle-snap-back-windows`, then drop a window on the padding, and use Raycast's "reasonable size" | HUD "Snap back · off"; both stay as they are until the next layout pass. |
| Drag a floating window around | It stays where you put it; nothing swaps. |

## Floating

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Open an app's Settings or a dialog (an app in `floating-secondary-windows`) | It floats; the app's first window stays tiled. |
| Quit an app whose window sat in a small tile, then reopen it | It tiles again (with `float-small-windows: false`). |
| Toggle float on a tiled window, then again | It floats, then rejoins the layout. |
| Tile Safari into a narrow tile | It sticks out at its minimum size but is still tiled: it moves with the layout (see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#a-window-looks-floating-but-is-tiled)). |

## Window limit

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Open one more window than `window-max-count` | The oldest window outside the main pane is minimised (or, once `window-overflow: float` exists, the new window floats). |
| Run `decrease-window-max-count` | The windows over the new limit follow the same rule. |
| 3Column Middle, main count 3 (left 1, main 3, right 1): close a main window | Main shrinks to 2; left and right keep their windows; no blank column. |
| Same, but ⌘H or minimise a main window instead | Main shrinks to 2. Unhide or unminimise it: it comes back at `main-arrival-position` (last: the end), not into main. |

## App-level

| Do | Expect |
|---|---|
| Reload Config | The app relaunches, keeps the current layout and applies the file. |
| Open the command palette, run a command | It runs; the app you were in stays in front. |
| Cycle the padding mode on the large display | The layout redraws in the new area instantly. |
| Launch with `--log` | The app starts and writes to `~/Library/Logs/Ametrine/Ametrine.log`. |
