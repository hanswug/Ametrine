# Saves the current fork/main build as a draft GitHub release: a zip of
# Ametrine.app signed with the local self-signed certificate (not
# notarised). Drafts are visible only to the repository owner; this is how
# Ametrine gets onto Hans's other Macs without building there.
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh major|minor|patch|current [--dry-run]
#
#   major, minor, patch  bump MARKETING_VERSION (semantic versioning, with the
#                        config file as the interface: a change that needs
#                        config edits is major), commit and push the bump,
#                        then release it as v<version>
#   current              release the version as it stands (e.g. the first one)
#   --dry-run            print what would be released and stop
#
# A draft creates no git tag, so earlier releases are read through gh.
#
# Runs the tests, then scripts/build.sh (which also installs and relaunches
# the app here), so the zip is exactly what runs on this Mac.

## Changes

${CHANGES}

## Install

Signed with a self-signed certificate, not notarised, so macOS blocks the first launch.

1. Unzip and move \`${APP_NAME}.app\` to /Applications. Quit upstream Amethyst if it's running; never run both at once.
2. Open ${APP_NAME}. When macOS blocks it, go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click **Open Anyway**.
3. Grant Accessibility when asked. On a Mac where a differently signed ${APP_NAME} had it, remove the old entry and grant it again.
4. The config lives at \`~/.config/ametrine/ametrine.yml\`; start from [ametrine.sample.yml](https://github.com/${REPO}/blob/${BRANCH}/ametrine.sample.yml).
